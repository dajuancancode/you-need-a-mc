      "In this age of meetings and conferences for just about everything, nothing breaks the momentum like the “silence” of not knowing what is happening next. A professional emcee is not an added expense to your program. Your event emcee is an extension of your organization that can help you keep your audience engaged, entertained, edified, and enlightened.\n\nWe don't just show up on the day of the event and work from the guest program. We get to know our clients and take time to really understand their mission so that we can deliver a seamless and engaging experience.\n\nWe accomplish this by doing our research, understanding your program goals and being in position to deliver the ultimate impact. We avoid distractions and event pitfalls by following the agenda, making appropriate transitions and keeping your meeting on schedule.\n\nWe spotlight your stakeholders and vendors in a meaningful way that adds value but does nor bore your audience and we always end your program on a high note. Our goal is to positively impact your audience throughout the event and meet our overarching goal to “leave 'em speechless”!\n\nYou Need a SKILLED MC for your Meetings and Conferences...period. Don't risk all your hard work and vision for a successful event by making the importance of an emcee a low priority. We just happen to know someone pretty awesome! Click below to learn more!",

      "Long gone are the days of the talking D.J. While there are still some around, they are already tasked with keeping the music right. Anticipating that same person to make appropriate introductions may prove difficult to manage. That's where You Need A MC can complement the experience.\n\nWorking in tandem with your D.J., we help set the tone, introduce the bridal party and then make the big announcement for the entry of the Mr. & Mrs. In addition, we announce all those important activities that take place during the reception to keep your event on track and minimize the distractions from that one guest that has something to say but may have celebrated a bit too much (wink wink)!\n\nYou Need A TALENTED MC for your Wedding Reception. Inquire within!",

    body:
      "Book launches are a perfect place where You Need A QUALIFIED MC. Why? Because hosting a book launch without a program is like fishing without a line. People come to the launch to learn, laugh, celebrate, and ultimately make a purchase. Our ability to position you and your new book in a way that creates excitement and builds momentum could be the “line” you need to sell more books.\n\nThe same goes for Product Launches. You Need A KNOWLEDGEABLE MC to help you disseminate information and market your product without making the audience feel like they are being “sold”. You Need A PERSONABLE MC that can represent your brand, interview your participants and help you gather those onsite testimonials that can be used to promote your product for years to come.\n\nThe value of hiring a professional emcee in times like these is critical. Don't miss the opportunity to maximize the moment for the current and future marketing efforts of your book or product launch.",
